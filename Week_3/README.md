# 📅 Week 3: Stack

A **stack** is a linear data structure that follows the **Last In, First Out (LIFO)** principle. Elements are inserted (pushed) and removed (popped) only from the **top** of the stack. Stacks are widely used in memory management, expression evaluation, function calls, and parsing tasks.

### 🔹 Key Points:
- Operations: `push()`, `pop()`, `peek()`, `isEmpty()`, `size()`
- Follows **LIFO** principle
- Can be implemented using arrays or linked lists
- Applications include **expression evaluation**, **syntax parsing**, **backtracking**, and **recursion simulation**

## 🧠 Questions Covered

This week focuses on implementing stacks and solving bracket-related problems that are frequently asked in **coding interviews and competitive programming**.

### ✅ Problems:

1. 📦 **Stack Implementation Using Array**  

2. 🧮 **Check for Balanced Parentheses in an Expression**  

3. 📏 **Find Length of Longest Valid Parentheses Substring**  

These problems help in:
- Strengthening understanding of **stack operations**
- Practicing real-world applications like **bracket matching**
- Developing logic for **substring validation** using data structures

📍 Mastering stacks is a crucial step in building a strong foundation for topics like **recursion**, **parsing**, and **backtracking**.

# 📅 Week 2: Two Dimensional Array (Matrices)

A **2D array (matrix)** is a collection of elements arranged in **rows and columns**, often used to represent grids, tables, or matrices in programming. In C, it is implemented as an array of arrays. Matrix-based problems are widely used in both **academics** and **interviews** due to their logical complexity and application in real-world systems like image processing and dynamic programming.

### 🔹 Key Points:
- A 2D array is accessed using two indices: `matrix[i][j]`
- Stored in **row-major order** in memory (by default in C)
- Can be used to represent graphs, boards, images, etc.
- Common operations: Traversal, Search, Rotation, and Transformation

## 🧠 Questions Covered

This week focuses on matrix problems that improve understanding of **multi-dimensional data handling** and are important in **placement preparation**.

### ✅ Problems:

1. 🔍 **Search in Row and Column-wise Sorted Matrix**  

2. 🧮 **Row with Maximum Number of 1s in Boolean Matrix**  

3. 🔄 **Rotate Elements of Matrix Clockwise**

These problems help in:
- Strengthening the understanding of **2D data structures**
- Practicing logical implementation of **matrix traversal and transformation**
- Enhancing confidence in solving **interview-level matrix problems**

## ✨ Additional Highlight: **Spiral Matrix Traversal**

This is a classic matrix problem where elements are printed in a **spiral order**, starting from the top-left and moving clockwise layer by layer. It's important for learning **boundary control and direction management** in matrix problems and is commonly seen in **coding interviews**.

📍 Mastering matrices is key to advancing in topics like **dynamic programming** and **graph theory**.

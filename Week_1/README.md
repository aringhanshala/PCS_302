# 📅 Week 1: Arrays

An **array** is a linear data structure that stores elements of the same type in **contiguous memory locations**. It allows **random access** using indices, making operations like traversal and search efficient.

### 🔹 Key Points:
- Arrays are **zero-indexed** in C.
- Memory is allocated **statically** (fixed size).
- Elements are stored **sequentially in RAM**.
- Operations: Traversal, Insertion, Deletion, Searching, Sorting.

## 🧠 Questions Covered

This week focuses on solving array problems that form the foundation of DSA and are **frequently asked in coding interviews**.

### ✅ Problems:

1. 🔄 **Left Rotation of Array**  

2. 📏 **Minimum Distance Between Two Elements**  

3. 🔍 **Find the Odd Occurring Element**  

These problems are:
- Essential for understanding **array manipulation**
- Helpful for building logic for **pointer-based operations**
- Common in **placement interviews** and **online coding platforms**

📍 These problems are not only helpful for understanding **array manipulation** and **index logic**, but also build a strong base for solving advanced DSA problems.
